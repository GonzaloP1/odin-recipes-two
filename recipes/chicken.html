        <h2>Tasty chicken</h2>
            <p>This baked chicken with cream of chicken soup is made with boneless chicken breasts or chicken tenders covered with cream of chicken soup. Chicken, creamy chicken, everywhere! If desired, serve over egg noodles. You may substitute cream of chicken, half-and-half, or water for milk if desired.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>1 pinch poultry seasoning</li>
                <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
                <li>10Â½ ounces milk</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish; season with poultry seasoning.</li>
                <li>Mix together condensed soup and milk in a bowl. Pour soup mixture evenly over chicken.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
